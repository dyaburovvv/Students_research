# Students research

In the scope of this intermediate educational project, I conducted a data analysis of course students, their exam results, and course registration/completion dates. To achieve the project goals, I utilized main Python libraries, applied RFM analysis for user segmentation, and independently interpreted the data used in the project. All the questions that needed to be answered during the project are specified in the Jupyter Notebook

**All datasets are attached in .csv format**
