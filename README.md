# Students research

In the scope of this intermediate educational project, I conducted a data analysis of course students, their exam results, and course registration/completion dates. To achieve the project goals, I utilized main Python libraries, applied RFM analysis for user segmentation, and independently interpreted the data used in the project. All the questions that needed to be answered during the project are specified in the Jupyter Notebook

In the project, I utilized pandas, numpy, and RFM analysis.

I used pandas, a powerful data manipulation library, for handling and analyzing the project's datasets. It provided efficient data structures and functions to clean, transform, and filter the data.

Numpy, a fundamental package for scientific computing in Python, was employed for numerical computations and mathematical operations. It enabled me to perform various calculations efficiently, such as aggregations and statistical analyses.

Additionally, I implemented RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) analysis, a technique widely used in marketing and customer segmentation. RFM analysis allowed me to evaluate customer behavior based on their recency of purchases, frequency of purchases, and monetary value of transactions. This approach helped uncover valuable insights into customer segmentation and identify high-value customers.

Overall, these tools and techniques, including pandas, numpy, and RFM analysis, played a crucial role in the successful execution of the project and the generation of meaningful insights. ðŸ’¡
